<h2>How to set up the environment</h2>
For this project, as in previous projects, you are going to use 
a VMware virtual machine. Again, you can work on your own machine
or you can use the machines in room B230 in the basement of EBU3B.

<p>
<strong>Setting up Boxes on your own machine:</strong>
Download the Boxes2/X virtual machine tarball,
<A href="boxes2x-2.2.tar.bz2">boxes2x-2.2.tar.bz2</a> (warning: 400
MB!).  Note that this is not the same tarball as the one in previous
projects, so you cannot use those tarballs.  Decompress this tarball
and run it using VMware Player, as you did for the first project.
Once the Boxes 2/X VM is running, you will want to start X and run the
Iceweasel browser, <a href="#iceweasel">as described below</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Using Boxes on the B230 machines:</strong> You will want to
perfrom the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Log in to any B230 machine under Linux using your CSE 127 username
    and password, which you can
    find <a href="https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php">on the ACMS
    site</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a subdirectory (say named after your cse127 username, so that
    you can distinguish it from other direcotries) in the 
    <code>/scratch</code> directory, and set the permissions for that
    directory to <code>700</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extract the Boxes virtual machine
    file <code>/home/linux/ieng6/cs127s/public/boxes2x-2.2.tar.bz2</code>
    to your scratch work directory.  If, for example, your scratch
    directory is called <code>foobar</code>, then the following
    commands will work:
    <blockquote>
      <code>cd /scratch/foobar</code><br/>
      <code>tar xjf ~/../public/boxes2x-2.2.tar.bz2</code>
    </blockquote>
    Unfortunately there is not enough space in your home directory to
    extract the VM image, which is why you must use the lab
    machine&rsquo;s local scratch space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run VMware Workstation or VMware Player.  In either case, use it
    to open the <code>Boxes2X.vmx</code> file located
    under <code>/scratch/foobar/Boxes2X.vmwarevm</code>.  Once the
    Boxes 2/X VM is running, you will want to start X and run the
    Iceweasel browser, <a href="#iceweasel">as described below</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    We recommend that you back up all of your work, using
    <a href="#backups">the backup procedure described below</a>.  If,
    in addition, you wish to save the state of your entire VM, you can
    shut down VMware and then create a tarball of
    the <code>Boxes2X.vmwarevm</code> directory, then copy that
    tarball into your home directory on ieng6.  If, again, your
    scratch directory is called <code>foobar</code>, then the
    following commands will work:
    <blockquote>
      <code>cd /scratch/student</code><br/>
      <code>tar cvf boxesimg.tar Boxes2X.vmwarevm</code><br/>
      <code>bzip2 boxesimg.tar</code>
      <code>mv boxesimg.tar ~</code>
    </blockquote>
    Now if you want to run the saved box, in step 3 instead of
    extracting the VM image from the <code>public/</code> directory,
    you will extract the one you saved in your home directory.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="iceweasel">How to run iceweasel</h2>

<p>
  The Web server serving the Zoobar site you will be attacking is
  hosted inside the VM.  (If you try to connect to zoobar.org outside
  the VM, you will get Stanford's site, which you
  should <strong>not</strong> try to interact with.)  Furthermore, the
  Web browser you'll use to develop and test your attacks is also
  hosted inside the VM.  It is called Iceweasel.
</p>
<p>
  Iceweasel is the Debian version of Firefox&mdash;essentially the
  same browser, but with a different name because of licensing issues.
  To start iceweasel in Boxes 2/X, log in as user, and do the
  following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type the <code>startx</code> command.  This will start the X
    Windowing System, and a new window will be displayed with a
    xterm (shell) where you can enter commands.  (Click the mouse
    to place the window.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>iceweasel &</code> within the newly displayed xterm.
    This will open the Iceweasel browser.  (Again, click the mouse
    to place the window.)
  </li>
  <li>
    In the URL bar, you can type <code>http://zoobar.org/</code> to
    connect to the Zoobar site.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="backups">Backing up your work</h2>

<p>
  As with any project, you will want to make and keep frequent backups
  of your work.  If you are developing your code in
  <code>user</code>&rsquo; home directory inside the VM, then an easy
  way to back this directory up is with the <code>rsync</code>
  command.
<p>
<p>
  Suppose that the IP address assigned to the VM
  is <code>172.16.xxx.yyy</code>.  (You can find this address
  using <code>/sbin/ifconfig eth0</code> inside the VM.)  And suppose
  you'd like to back up into a directory called <code>bkp123</code>
  in your ieng6 home directory.  Run the following command from the
  B230 lab machine prompt:
  <blockquote>
    <code>rsync -av user@172.16.xxx.yyy:/home/user/ ~/bkp123/</code>
  </blockquote>
  If you run this command again later it will update the contents
  of <code>bkp123</code> to match the contents of
  </code>user</code>&rsquo;s home directory.
</p>
<p>
  To restore from backup, run the following command, again from the
  B230 lab machine prompt:
  <blockquote>
    <code>rsync -av ~/bkp123/ user@172.16.xxx.yyy:/home/user/</code>
  </blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
  The fictional &ldquo;Zoobar Foundation&rdquo; has set up a simple
  Web application at <code>zoobar.org</code> (inside the Boxes 2/X
  VM), allowing registered users to post profiles and transfer
  &ldquo;zoobar&rdqo; credits between each other. Each registered user
  starts with 10 zoobars.
</p>

<p>
  You will craft a series of attacks on <code>zoobar.org</code> that
  exploit vulnerabilities in the Website&rsquo;s design.  Each attack
  presents a distinct scenario with unique goals and constraints,
  although in some cases you may be able to reuse parts of your
  code.
</p>

<p>
  Although many real-world attackers do not have the source code for
  the Websites they are attacking, you are one of the lucky ones: you
  can find the source code under <code>/var/zoobar/www</code> in the
  Boxes 2/X VM.
</p>

<P>The zoobar server is actually run locally on each of your boxes.
We will run your attacks after wiping clean our own local database of
registered users (except the user named "attacker").  Of course this
means that any data you have added while working on the assignment
will <EM>not</EM> be present during grading.

<H3>Setup</H3>

<p>
  <strong>Browser:</strong> We will grade your project within the
  Boxes 2/X VM, using the Iceweasel browser.  which is installed in
  the Boxes. Therefore, you should test your code in the boxes on this
  browser.  Iceweasel is essentially the same browser as Firefox, but
  under different branding.  Anything that works in iceweasel will
  likely work in (the same version of) Firefox as well.
</p>
<p>
  There are subtle quirks in the way HTML and JavaScript are handled
  by different browsers, and some attacks that work in Internet
  Explorer (for example) may not work in Firefox (and therefore in
  Iceweasel).  In particular, you should use the Mozilla way of
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener">adding
  listeners to events</a>.
</p>

<P><B>Email script</B>. For Attacks A and D, you will
need a server-side script to automatically email information 
captured by your client-side JavaScript to your user account within the Boxes. We have provided this script for you.
Please review the instructions at 
<A href="http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php">http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php</A> (open
this url from within the Boxes)
and use that URL in your attack scripts to send emails. Again,
this server is also being run locally on your own boxes machine.
To check your local email use the mutt email client (type
<B><KBD>mutt</KBD></B> in the shell to start the client, and follow the instructions).
</P>

<hr/>

<h2>Attack A. Cookie Theft</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a URL starting with 
    <code>http://zoobar.org/users.php?</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will already be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code>
    before loading your URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your goal is to steal the document cookie and email it
    to yourself using the 
    <a href="http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php">email script</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Except for the browser address bar (which can be different), the
    grader should see a page that looks <em>exactly</em> as it
    normally does when the grader visits
    <code><a href="http://zoobar.org/users.php">users.php</a></code>.
    No changes to the site appearance or extraneous text should be
    visible.  Avoiding the <em>red warning text</em> is an important
    part of this attack. (It&rsquo;s ok if the page looks weird
    briefly before correcting itself.)
  </li>
  <li>Hint: Here is
    <a href="http://zoobar.org/users.php?user=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E">an
      example attack</a> to use as a starting point.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack B. Cross-Site Request Forgery</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a short HTML document that the grader will open
    using the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will already be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code>
    before loading your page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer 10 zoobars from the grader's account to the
    &ldquo;<code>attacker</code>&rdquo; account. The browser should be
    redirected to
    <CODE>http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa11/cse127-a</CODE> as soon
    as the transfer is complete (so fast the user might not notice).
  </li>
  <li>
    The location bar of the browser should not contain 
    <code>zoobar.org</code> at any point.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack C. SQL Injection</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a short HTML document that the grader will open
    using the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will not be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code> before
    loading your page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your HTML document should display a form with a text field and a
    button.  The grader will type a username into the text field and
    press the button.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a result, the grader should be logged in
    to <code>zoobar.org</code> as the user whose name was typed in the
    text field.  The browser's location bar should be redirected
    to <code>http://zoobar.org/index.php</code>, and the page should
    look and behave exactly as if the grader had instead typed the
    username and corresponding password in the
    legitimate <code>zoobar.org</code> login form.
  </li>
  <li>
    The name the grader types in will already be registered in the
    with some password.  You do not need to handle the case in which
    the name was not already registered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hint: What part of the <code>zoobar.org</code> PHP code handles
    the user login and registration, and how does it interface with
    the SQLite database?
  </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Attack D. Password Theft</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a short HTML document that the grader will open
    using the browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    The grader will not be logged in to <code>zoobar.org</code> before
    loading your page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upon loading your document, the browser should immediately be
    redirected to <code>http://zoobar.org/</code>.  The grader will
    enter a username and password and press the &ldquo;Log in&rdquo;
    button.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the &ldquo;Log in&rdquo; button is pressed, send the username
    and password (separated by a comma) using the
    <a href="http://zoomail.org/sendmail.php">e-mail script</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The login form should appear perfectly normal to the user. No
    extraneous text (e.g. warnings) should be visible, and assuming
    the username and password are correct the login should proceed the
    same way it always does.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hint: The site uses
    <code><a href="http://www.php.net/htmlspecialchars">htmlspecialchars()</A></code>
    to sanitize the reflected username, but something is not quite
    right.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Attack E. Profile Worm</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Your solution is a profile that, when viewed, transfers 1 zoobar
    from the current user to a user called
    &ldquo;<code>attacker</code>&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s an actual
    username) and replaces the profile of the current user with
    itself.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your malicious profile may include a witty message to the grader
    (optional, but it helps us see that it replicated).
  </li>
  <li>
    To grade your attack, we will cut and paste the submitted profile
    file into the profile of the "attacker" user and view that profile
    using the grader's account. We will then view the copied profile
    with more accounts, checking for the transfer and
    replication.
  </li>
  <li>
    The transfer and replication should be reasonably fast (under 15
    seconds).  During that time, the grader will not click
    anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the transfer and replication process, 
    the browser's location bar should remain at 
    <code>http://zoobar.org/users.php?user=<em>username</em></code>,
    where <code><em>username</em></code> is the user whose profile is
    being viewed. The visitor should not see any extra graphical user
    interface elements (e.g. frames), and the user whose profile is
    being viewed should appear to have 10 zoobars.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will not be graded on the corner case where the user viewing
    the profile has no zoobars to send.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hint: The site allows a sanitized subset of HTML in profiles, but
    you can get around it.
    This <A href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa11/cse127-a/myspace-advisory.txt">MySpace
    vulnerability</a> may provide some inspiration.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<H2>Deliverables</h2>

<p>
  Create files named <code>a.txt</code>, <code>b.html</code>,
  <code>c.html</code>, <code>d.html</code>, and <code>e.txt</code>,
  containing each of your five attacks.  You may include a
  separate <code>README</code> file.  (We would appreciate any
  feedback you may have on this assignment).  Submission instructions
  will be posted to Piazza.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>For Part One, Attacks A and B are due.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>For Part Two, Attacks C and D are due.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>For Part Three, Attack E is due.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The last two attacks are harder than the first three.  We encourage
  you to start early!
</p>


<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
  Each attack is worth up to 4 points.  The entire project will be
  graded out of 20.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Beware of Race Conditions</em>: Depending on how you write your
  code, all five of these attacks could potentially have race
  conditions that affect the success of your attacks. Attacks that
  fail on the grader&rsquo;s browser during grading will receive less
  than full credit.  To ensure that you receive full credit, you
  should wait after making an outbound network request rather than
  assuming that the request will be sent immediately.
</p>
