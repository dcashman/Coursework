This attack takes advantage of the poor design of the zoobar site. In order to
implement the zoobar counter, line 42 of the users.php file evals the className
of the element with id equal to "zoobars", which the server will have populated
with a value equal to the number of zoobars of that user. Because the profile
comes before the span provided by the server, we can provide our own span with
an id of 'zoobars' and it will be the element returned by
document.getElementById, allowing us to execute arbitrary javascript by changing
the name of the class to be the javascript we want to execute. Once we have
reached this point, we can use XMLHttpRequest to issue the needed requests to
steal the zoobar and set the profile of the viewing user. The only other wrinkle
is that we have had to encode the ampersand to avoid it being mangled and
concatenated strings using the String.concat function for the same reason (that
is to say, the plus sign was being messed with).
